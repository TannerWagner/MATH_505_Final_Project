# Quasi–Monte Carlo vs Monte Carlo for High–Dimensional Integration

This project compares plain Monte Carlo (MC) and Sobol quasi–Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for approximating high–dimensional integrals over the unit cube \([0,1]^d\). It was completed as a final project for **MATH 505: Numerical Analysis** at the University of New Mexico.

The main goals are to:

- Implement MC and QMC estimators on \([0,1]^d\),
- Test them on several smooth integrands with known exact values,
- Study **error vs. sample size**, **error vs. time**, and the effect of **dimension** and **effective dimension**.

The full write–up is in `Report/report.pdf`.
